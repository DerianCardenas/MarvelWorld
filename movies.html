                    Marvel phases are a way of grouping several films in the MCU together. They may accomplish similar things or may all 
                    be a response to events from a previous film. It’s part of the design, Marvel Studios’ way of referencing several films 
                    at once. To date, the MCU movies have fallen under three Phases:                                   
                </p><br><br> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Phase 1 introduces us to each of the Avengers.<br></li>
                    <li>Phase 2 handles the fallout from The Avengers.<br></li>
                    <li>Phase 3 features an uneasiness among the superheroes after Avengers: Age of Ultron (and introduces more heroes), leading us into the showstopping Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.<br></li>
                    <li>Phase 4 will introduce a new wave of heroes and explore a post-Endgame world where half of the universe reappeared five years after an event known as the “Blip.”<br></li>
