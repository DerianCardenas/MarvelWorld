                    Marvel phases are a way of grouping several films in the MCU together. They may accomplish similar things or may all 
                    be a response to events from a previous film. It’s part of the design, Marvel Studios’ way of referencing several films 
                    at once. To date, the MCU movies have fallen under three Phases:                                   
                </p><br><br> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Phase 1 introduces us to each of the Avengers.<br></li>
                    <li>Phase 2 handles the fallout from The Avengers.<br></li>
                    <li>Phase 3 features an uneasiness among the superheroes after Avengers: Age of Ultron (and introduces more heroes), leading us into the showstopping Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.<br></li>
                    <li>Phase 4 will introduce a new wave of heroes and explore a post-Endgame world where half of the universe reappeared five years after an event known as the “Blip.”<br></li>

Living in the shadows--cut off from a life he knew and the woman he loves, Betty Ross--Banner struggles to avoid the obsessive pursuit of his nemesis, General Thunderbolt Ross and the military machinery that seeks to capture him and brutally exploit his power. As all three grapple with the secrets that led to the Hulk's creation, they are confronted with a monstrous new adversary known as the Abomination, whose destructive strength exceeds even the Hulk's own. One scientist must make an agonizing final choice: accept a peaceful life as Bruce Banner or find heroism in the creature he holds inside--The Incredible Hulk.

As punishment, Odin banishes Thor to Earth. While Loki, Thor's brother, plots mischief in Asgard, Thor, now stripped of his powers, faces his greatest threat.

                    The second phase focuses on the post-Battle of New York exploits of the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D., and also introduces more heroes, including Falcon, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Ant-Man, Wasp, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (consisting of Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon and Groot) and further explains the origin of the Infinity Stones. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the terrorist group HYDRA is revealed to have been operating within S.H.I.E.L.D., resulting in the agency's collapse. Now acting without assistance from S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers work solo to bring down HYDRA, but unintentionally spawn a more dangerous adversary in the form of the hostile artificial intelligence, Ultron.

                    Phase Three is set during a time of discord generated from the aftermath of Ultron's attack against the Earth.

Thanos' plot to collect all of the Infinity Stones, which began late in Phase One, is drawn to a close in this saga.<br>
