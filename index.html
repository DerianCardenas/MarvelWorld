				Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing,
				Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney 
				Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.<br>
				Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. 
				<!--The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by 
				Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as 
				the company's primary brand.-->

				<!--Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 
				1939.Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new 
				medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he 
				officially held the titles of editor, managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother) officially 
				listed as publisher.<br><br>-->
				Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, Wolverine, 
				Ant-Man, the Wasp, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, She-Hulk, 
				the Vision, the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Ghost Rider, Blade, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Ms. Marvel, Miles Morales, the Punisher, 
				Shang-Chi and Deadpool. Superhero teams exist such as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy.<br><br>
				The Marvel universe also features well-known supervillains including Doctor Doom, Magneto, Thanos, Loki, Green Goblin, Kingpin, Red Skull, 
				Ultron, the Mandarin, MODOK, Doctor Octopus, Kang, Dormammu, Venom and Galactus. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single 
				reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City.
				Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 
				and again since 2015.
